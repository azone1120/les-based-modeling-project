# LES-Based Modeling
## Description
This repository is part of my exploration into Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for turbulent reacting flows. The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of LES-based combustion modeling techniques, mesh sensitivity, and turbulence-chemistry interaction in buoyancy-driven plumes.

As an entry point, I replicate and analyze the study by Koo et al. (2017), which investigates the impact of combustion models and mesh resolution on LES predictions of a buoyant 1-meter methane fire plume. This foundational project will serve as a reference for future work in fire modeling, combustion physics, and CFD tool development.
