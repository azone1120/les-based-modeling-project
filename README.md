# LES-Based Modeling
## Description
This repository contains an attempt of a replication and analysis of the 2017 study by Koo et al., "Model sensitivities in LES predictions of buoyant methane fire plumes". The project explores how domain geometry, combustion models, and mesh resolution affect large eddy simulation (LES) predictions of buoyant, turbulent methane pool fires.

### Motivation
